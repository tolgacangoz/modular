"""This module provides functionality for interacting with accelerators. In
particular the

    device, and for compiling and running functions (also known as kernels) on

    The device context can be used as a

    ```mojo

    a `get_device_context()` method to retrieve the device context:

        This function allocates memory on the host that is accessible by the device.
        The memory is page-locked (pinned) for efficient data transfer between host and device.

        Pinned memory is guaranteed to remain resident in the host's RAM, not be
        paged/swapped out to disk. Memory allocated normally (for example, using
        [`alloc()`](/mojo/std/memory/unsafe_pointer/alloc))
        is pageable—individual pages of memory can be moved to secondary storage
        (disk/SSD) when main memory fills up.

        Using pinned memory allows devices to make fast transfers
        between host memory and device memory, because they can use direct
        memory access (DMA) to transfer data without relying on the CPU.

        Allocating too much pinned memory can cause performance issues, since it
        reduces the amount of memory available for other processes.

        Parameters:
            dtype: The data type to be stored in the allocated memory.

        Args:
            size: The number of elements of `type` to allocate memory for.

        This function performs compile-time type checking on the kernel arguments,
        ensuring that the types passed match the declared signature. Both `func` and
        `signature_func` should typically be the same kernel function (this redundancy
        is required for type checking and will be removed in future versions).

        Parameters:
            func_type: The type of the function to launch (usually inferred).
            declared_arg_types: The declared argument types from the function
                signature (usually inferred).
            func: The kernel function to compile and launch.
            signature_func: The kernel function, passed again for type checking.
                Typically the same as `func`.
            actual_arg_types: The types of the arguments being passed (usually inferred).
            dump_asm: To dump the compiled assembly, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            dump_llvm: To dump the generated LLVM code, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            _dump_sass: Only runs on NVIDIA targets, and requires CUDA Toolkit
                to be installed. Pass `True`, or a file path to dump to, or a
                function returning a file path.
            _ptxas_info_verbose: Only runs on NVIDIA targets, and requires CUDA
                Toolkit to be installed. Changes `dump_asm` to output verbose
                PTX assembly (default `False`).

        Args:
            args: Variadic arguments which are passed to the kernel function.
            grid_dim: The grid dimensions.

            cluster_dim: The cluster dimensions.
            shared_mem_bytes: Per-block memory shared between blocks.
            attributes: A `List` of launch attributes.
            constant_memory: A `List` of constant memory mappings.
            func_attribute: `CUfunction_attribute` enum.
            location: Source location for the function call.

        Most parameters are inferred automatically. In typical usage, you only
        need to pass the kernel function twice (as both `func` and `signature_func`):

        This overload is for kernels that capture variables from their enclosing scope.

                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            dump_llvm: To dump the generated LLVM code, pass `True`, or a file
                path to dump to, or a function returning a file path.
            _dump_sass: Only runs on NVIDIA targets, and requires CUDA Toolkit

            grid_dim: The grid dimensions.
            block_dim: The block dimensions.
            cluster_dim: The cluster dimensions.

        """Creates a new event for synchronization between streams.

        Provides the best performance by default, disabling timing and blocking sync.
        `DeviceContext.execution_time()` provides the functionality required for
        timing kernels by passing it a closure, and is functionally equivalent to
        recording start and end events, then calculating the elapsed time.

        Parameters:
            blocking_sync: Enable `event.synchronize()` to block until the event
                has been recorded. Incurs overhead compared to
                `stream.enqueue_wait_for(event)` (default: False).
            disable_timing: Remove timing overhead (default: True).
            interprocess: Enable interprocess synchronization, currently
                unimplemented. (default: False).
