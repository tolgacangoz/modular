        Continuously processes responses from the remote worker process.

        This method runs in a loop, pulling responses from the response socket and routing them
        to the appropriate pending queues. It also handles distributed garbage collection by
        detecting and cancelling requests that are no longer being waited for.

        Cancellation Handling:
        When a response is received for a request ID that doesn't have a pending queue,
        it means the client has given up waiting (due to disconnect, timeout, exception, or
        early termination). In this case, we send a cancellation message to the worker to:

        1. **Resource Optimization**: Tell the worker to stop wasting CPU/memory on requests
           nobody is waiting for
        2. **Prevent Resource Leaks**: The worker might be holding onto resources (memory,
           file handles, etc.) for cancelled requests
        3. **Backpressure Management**: Remove cancelled requests from the worker's queue
           to prevent them from blocking other work

        Common scenarios that trigger cancellation:
        - Client disconnects or times out while streaming
        - Exception occurs during stream processing
        - Async generator is closed early (stream.__aclose__())
        - Client process terminates unexpectedly

        This implements a distributed garbage collection pattern common in async systems
        where network operations are asynchronous and either side can fail or disconnect.

        Raises:
            Exception: If the worker process becomes unhealthy and cannot be recovered.
            asyncio.CancelledError: If the response worker task is cancelled.
